# InternPe Task 2
# TIC-TAC-TOE-GAME 
It is a task of InternPe Internship where I am serving a role of Python Programmer, where I developed a Tic-Tac-Toe Game.
In this Task  I used while loop to keep the game going until the player chooses not to play again. Here, The play_game function initializes the board and other variables, then enters the game loop where players take turns entering their move, and The is_game_over function checks if the game is over, and if so, whether there is a winner or a tie. If the game is over, then it ask again to play the game.
